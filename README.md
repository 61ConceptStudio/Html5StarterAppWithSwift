IonicStarterAppWithSwift
========================
An xcode project that displays HTML contents in a webView where the web content is powered by the [Ionic framework]. This purpose of this repo is to serve as a starting point for anyone who wants to build a 'native' HTML5 based iOS app using the Ionic framework without using [Cordova]. Should you want to how this repo came to be i.e. the idea, motivation etc you can have a read about it in my [blog post].

Some time ago, I added a new branch to this repositiory called Notifications, it contains some code to schedule, cancel and print(to console) local notifications from the html buttons in a UIWebView. The details of that that branch are explained [here].

If you are going to clone this project or use it in anyway, it would be great if you can look at this [issue]. Bascially what the issue asks is, if you have any suggestions on how I can improve this project template or any new features that I can add to this, please let me know, and I will see what I can do to accomplish it.
