IonicStarterAppWithSwift
========================
An xcode project that displays HTML contents in a webView where the web content is powered by the [Ionic framework]. This purpose of this repo is to serve as a starting point for anyone who wants to build a 'native' HTML5 based iOS app using the Ionic framework without using [Cordova]. Should you want to how this repo came to be i.e. the idea, motivation etc you can have a read about it in my [blog post].

Some time ago, I added a new branch to this repositiory called Notifications, it contains some code to schedule, cancel and print(to console) local notifications from the html buttons in a UIWebView. The details of that that branch are explained [here].
